# helium-windows

Windows packaging for [helium-chromium](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-chromium).

## Credits

This repo is based on
[ungoogled-chromium-windows](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows),
but is pretty heavily modified for Helium. Huge shout-out to everyone behind ungoogled-chromium,
they made working with Chromium infinitely easier.

## Building

#### Setting up Visual Studio

[Follow the "Visual Studio" section of the official Windows build instructions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/windows_build_instructions.md#visual-studio).

* Make sure to read through the entire section and install/configure all the required components.
* If your Visual Studio is installed in a directory other than the default, you'll need to set a few environment variables to point the toolchains to your installation path. (Copied from [instructions for Electron](https://electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-windows))
	* `vs2019_install = DRIVE:\path\to\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community` (replace `2019` and `Community` with your installed versions)
	* `WINDOWSSDKDIR = DRIVE:\path\to\Windows Kits\10`
	* `GYP_MSVS_VERSION = 2019` (replace 2019 with your installed version's year)

#### Other build requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Currently, the `MAX_PATH` path length restriction (which is 260 characters by default)
must be lifted in for our Python build scripts. This can be lifted in Windows 10 (v1607 or newer) with
the official installer for Python 3.6 or newer (you will see a button at the end of installation to do
this). See [Issue #345](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium/issues/345) for other
methods for older Windows versions.

1. Setup the following:
    * 7-Zip
    * Python 3.8 or above
		* Can be installed using WinGet or the Microsoft Store.
		* If you don't plan on using the Microsoft Store version of Python:
			* Check "Add python.exe to PATH" before install.
			* At the end of the Python installer, click the button to lift the `MAX_PATH` length restriction.
			* Disable the `python3.exe` and `python.exe` aliases in `Settings > Apps > Advanced app settings > App execution aliases`. They will typically be referred to as "App Installer". See [this question on stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57485491/python-python3-executes-in-command-prompt-but-does-not-run-correctly) to understand why.
			* Ensure that your Python directory either has a copy of Python named "python3.exe" or a symlink linking to the Python executable.
		* The `httplib2` module. This can be installed using `pip install`.
    * Make sure to lift the `MAX_PATH` length restriction, either by clicking the button at the end of the Python installer or by [following these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry#:~:text=Enable,Later).
    * Git (to fetch all required ungoogled-chromium scripts)
        * During setup, make sure "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" is selected. This is usually the recommended option.

### Building

Run in `Developer Command Prompt for VS` (as administrator):

```cmd
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/imputnet/helium-windows.git
cd helium-windows
# Replace TAG_OR_BRANCH_HERE with a tag or branch name
git checkout --recurse-submodules TAG_OR_BRANCH_HERE
python3 build.py
python3 package.py
```

A zip archive and an installer will be created under `build`.

**NOTE**: If the build fails, you must take additional steps before re-running the build:

* If the build fails while downloading the Chromium source code (which is during `build.py`), it can be fixed by removing `build\download_cache` and re-running the build instructions.
* If the build fails at any other point during `build.py`, it can be fixed by removing everything under `build` other than `build\download_cache` and re-running the build instructions. This will clear out all the code used by the build, and any files generated by the build.

An efficient way to delete large amounts of files is using `Remove-Item PATH -Recurse -Force`. Be careful however, files deleted by that command will be permanently lost.

## Developer info

### First-time setup

1. [Setup MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/)
2. Run the following in a "MSYS2 MSYS" shell:

```sh
pacman -S quilt python3 vim tar
# By default, there doesn't seem to be a vi command for less, quilt edit, etc.
ln -s /usr/bin/vim /usr/bin/vi
```

### Updating patches and pruning list

1. Start `Developer Command Prompt for VS` and `MSYS2 MSYS` shell and navigate to source folder
	1. `Developer Command Prompt for VS`
		* `cd c:\path\to\repo\helium-windows`
	1. `MSYS2 MSYS`
		* `cd /path/to/repo/helium-windows`
		* You can use Git Bash to determine the path to this repo
		* Or, you can find it yourself via `/<drive letter>/<path with forward slashes>`
